Implemented simulated annealing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals as part of the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.

I found an alternative method for loading successor configurations that achieves better results than the recommended method. Further, it does not suffer from the same instability that the recommended method did.

Details are in the Jupyter notebook, including a short summary and discussion at the bottom.
